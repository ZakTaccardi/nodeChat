I ran the below comments in the mongoDB shell to create a small database

//inserts a record into the database
db.chat.save({"name": "Zak", "msg": "Hey greg, why are you so greggish?"})
db.chat.save({"name": "Greg", "msg": "I don't know zak, I just am"});


//returns everything in the database
db.chat.find();
